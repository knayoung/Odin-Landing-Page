# Odin-Landing-Page

After completing the flexbox module, I am now tasked with creating a landing page with everything I have learned. 

On the second day of doing the project, I realized I should probably map out how many flexboxes are needed and contained within each section rather than just aimlessly typing "display: flex;" hoping that it will fix any issues I have made.
